# TEST LIBRARY

The test library is a small testing system inspired by a project from CppGoneWild (my first mentor).

The main file is pretty straightforward but for non code readers ... what are you doing here?

Any way for the Foundlings!

In every function including main I put a local error counter, it keeps track of the number of errors.

### this system is expecially good for testing small algorithms. Once you have too many moving parts it becomes too heavy to maintain.
